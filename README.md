Transfer learning is a deep learning technique enables developers to harness a neural network used for one task and apply it to another task.
Letâ€™s say that you want to identify your own face. With transfer learning, we begin with an existing convolutional neural network commonly used for image recognition of other human faces, and we tweak it to train with our face image. For better understanding here is a small project on face recognition with VGG16 using a webcam.
